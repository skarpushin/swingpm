# Presentation Model design pattern implementation
This is a humble take on implementation of Presentation Model design pattern for Java Swing desktop applications.

It's not meant to be the reference one and the only implementation. What it is meant is to be a simple and convenient tool for building small Java Swing-based desktop applications. 

It's prooved itself to be convenient to use in multiple projects, including open-sourced [PGP Tool](https://pgptool.github.io/)
